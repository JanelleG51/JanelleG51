Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Janelle, a pending full stack developer based in Scotland.

After a number of years, I've finally found what I wish I has been doing all along - better late than never.

I found the right path after realising I was always being asked to pick up the more technical aspects of projects and enjoyed carrying them out. After some research and guidance from others in the industry, I enrolled with the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/full-stack-software-development-diploma-uk/) and I am currently completing a Diploma in Full Stack Software Development.


So here I am, learning everything I can right now, figuring out the problems as I go and looking forward to the new world ahead.
